Constructing a Map (as a Team)
--------------------------------

For our navigation mission, we we hold a cooperative mission with other teams.

- For each team, 3 map panels will be given.
- As a team try to arrange the panels so that there is a clear starting and finishing zone. For example:

Mapping the Constructed Map
----------------------------------------------

Place the Zetabot on the starting location of the map. 


You can see the following screen by opening your web browser and accessing 10.42.0.1:5000:

1. Select the Mapping button. 
   
   - This will start the mapping simulation. Using SLAM method, the robot will utilize its LIDAR sensors as well as multiple odometry sensors to map out its immediate surroundings. 
   - By using the controller, move the Zetabot around the constructed map to learn its surroundings.
